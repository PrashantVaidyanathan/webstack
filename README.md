##About this repository


The stack contains the Server technologies, CSS Frameworks, Javascript UI Frameworks, Databases and Cloud Providers. By including both the technologies and the learning resources to use these technologies, the repository hopes to bridge any knowledge gap that a developer might have.

##Ideology

There are a lot of frameworks out there that might do the job better or come with more functionality inbuilt. But the primary goal of this webstack is to simplify the development and reduce the learning curves to the bare minimum. 

An important but subtle aspect of the webstack that would eventually be reflected in the coding style guide would be the efforts towards making the entire model, view, view model completely independent on each other. This is achieved by not relying on templating tools to generate the views and by minimizing MVC patterns. 

Minimizing MVC patterns does bring up many other challenges but I believe this truly allows the developers to reuse their Views(HTML - CSS), View Models(Javascript) on any serverside language of the developer's choice. This allows the stack to be language agnostic.

##Contents

Our Stack.md - Contains the technologies and frameworks that this stack is comprised of.

Study Plan.md - Contains the tutorials that are used for implementing the stack.


##What this isn't

- The best way to make cloud applications - It strictly is the way I make them (there are probably countless better ways to build them)
- The cloud providers listed are my favorite providers, because I find them extrememly easy to use and the fact that they always have the exact pricing tiers I need. You can use the stack or portions of it with any cloud provider in the market.
- The stack though might talk a lot of Nodejs, it is hoped that more languages like python, ruby and even PHP can make it into the list. The stack is aimed at being language agnostic.
